# Welcome to SU Craftable Name Tag!

We're excited to announce the release of **SU Craftable Name Tag**, a simple yet useful Minecraft Fabric mod that adds a crafting recipe for name tags.

## What is this mod?

SU Craftable Name Tag is a lightweight Fabric mod that makes name tags craftable in survival mode. In vanilla Minecraft, name tags can only be obtained through fishing, trading with villagers, or finding them in chests. This mod adds a simple crafting recipe using common materials.

## Why create this mod?

Name tags are incredibly useful for:
- **Pet identification** on servers
- **Zoo exhibits** with named animals  
- **Storytelling** with named NPCs
- **Organization** of livestock

However, obtaining them in vanilla Minecraft can be frustrating and time-consuming. This mod solves that problem by making them easily craftable.

## Features

- **Simple crafting recipe** using string, paper, and iron ingots
- **Server-side only** - no client installation required
- **Lightweight** - minimal performance impact
- **Compatible** - works with vanilla clients

## Getting Started

1. **Download the mod** from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/su-craftable-name-tag) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/survivorsunited/mods-su-craftable-name-tag/releases)
2. **Install Fabric Loader** on your server
3. **Place the JAR file** in your server's `mods` folder
4. **Start your server** and enjoy craftable name tags!

## Crafting Recipe

```
[String] [Paper] [String]
[Paper] [Iron Ingot] [Paper]
[String] [Paper] [String]
```

This recipe yields 1 name tag and uses:
- 4x String
- 4x Paper
- 1x Iron Ingot

## Future Plans

We plan to:
- **Add more crafting variations** for different material costs
- **Support additional Minecraft versions** as they're released
- **Improve documentation** and add more guides
- **Consider community suggestions** for new features
