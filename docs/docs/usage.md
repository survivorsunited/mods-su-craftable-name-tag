# Usage Guide

Learn how to use SU Craftable Name Tag to create and use name tags in your Minecraft world.

## Crafting Name Tags

### Required Materials

To craft a name tag, you'll need:

- **1x String** - Obtained from spiders, cobwebs, or breaking wool
- **2x Iron Ingots** - Smelted from iron ore or obtained from iron golems

### Crafting Recipe

Arrange the materials in a crafting table as follows:

```
[Empty] [Empty] [String]
[Empty] [Iron Ingot] [Empty]
[Iron Ingot] [Empty] [Empty]
```

This will yield **1 name tag**.

### Crafting Tips

- **String farming**: Set up a spider spawner farm for efficient string collection
- **Iron mining**: Use an iron farm or mine in caves for iron ingots

## Using Name Tags

### Naming Items

1. **Place an anvil** in your world
2. **Right-click the anvil** to open it
3. **Place the name tag** in the left slot
4. **Type a name** in the text field
5. **Take the named name tag** from the right slot

### Applying to Mobs

1. **Hold the named name tag** in your hand
2. **Right-click on a mob** (horse, cow, sheep, etc.)
3. **The mob will be named** with the name you chose

### Compatible Mobs

Name tags work on most passive and neutral mobs:

- **Farm Animals**: Cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, horses, donkeys, mules
- **Wild Animals**: Wolves, cats, foxes, rabbits, llamas
- **Other Mobs**: Villagers, iron golems, snow golems, parrots

### Limitations

- **Cannot rename hostile mobs** (zombies, skeletons, etc.)
- **Cannot rename players**
- **Cannot rename already named mobs**
- **Name tags are consumed** when used

## Advanced Usage

### Bulk Crafting

For servers or large builds, you might need many name tags:

1. **Set up automated farms** for materials
2. **Use multiple crafting tables** for efficiency
3. **Store materials in chests** near your crafting area

### Creative Building

Name tags are great for:

- **Pet identification** on servers
- **Zoo exhibits** with named animals
- **Storytelling** with named NPCs
- **Organization** of livestock

### Server Management

For server administrators:

- **Monitor name tag usage** through server logs
- **Set up crafting areas** for players
- **Consider economy integration** if using plugins

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Can't craft name tag:**
- Ensure you have all required materials
