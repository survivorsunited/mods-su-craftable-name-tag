# Installation Guide

This guide will help you install SU Craftable Name Tag on your Minecraft server.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the mod, ensure you have:

- **Minecraft Server** running version 1.21.x
- **Fabric Loader** installed on your server
- **Java 21** or higher

## Server Installation

### Step 1: Download the Mod

Download the latest version of SU Craftable Name Tag from one of these sources:

- **[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/su-craftable-name-tag)** (Recommended)
- **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/survivorsunited/mods-su-craftable-name-tag/releases)**

### Step 2: Install Fabric Loader

If you haven't already installed Fabric Loader:

1. Download Fabric Loader from [fabricmc.net](https://fabricmc.net/use/)
2. Run the Fabric installer
3. Select your Minecraft version (1.21.x)
4. Install to your server directory

### Step 3: Install the Mod

1. **Stop your Minecraft server**
2. **Navigate to your server directory**
3. **Find the `mods` folder** (create it if it doesn't exist)
4. **Copy the downloaded JAR file** into the `mods` folder
5. **Start your server**

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Once your server starts:

1. **Check the server console** for any error messages
2. **Join the server** and try crafting a name tag
3. **Verify the recipe works** by placing the required materials in a crafting table

## Client Installation

**This mod is server-side only!** Players do not need to install any client-side mods to use the crafting recipe.

However, if you want to install it on the client for single-player worlds:

1. **Install Fabric Loader** on your client
2. **Download the mod** from the same sources
3. **Place the JAR file** in your client's `mods` folder
4. **Launch Minecraft** with the Fabric profile

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Mod not working:**
- Ensure you're using the correct Minecraft version (1.21.x)
- Verify Fabric Loader is properly installed
- Check that the JAR file is in the correct `mods` folder

**Server won't start:**
- Check the server console for error messages
- Ensure you have Java 21+ installed
- Verify all dependencies are compatible

**Recipe not appearing:**
- Restart the server after installing the mod

- Verify you're using a crafting table (not a crafting grid)
